## Project name: AGS(Air Guitar System)

Group memeber: Carmen Sing, John Kim, Yiyi Yan, Harry Li, Ringo Wong
Introduction: The Air Guitar System (AGS) is designed to mimic the abilities of an electric guitar but playability of a simpler instrument, the bass guitar.  Much of the design consideration has been geared towards accurate sound replications and ease of use in order to mitigate a learning curve.  Our team will create a fully functional instrument that can be played anytime, anywhere.  Our guitar will not require strings, large sound board or further tuning.  Aside from mimicking the ability of a regular guitar to stop music and vary volumes based on strumming patterns, many additional features have been included to improve upon a regular guitar.   

## code example:
\#include "Project.h"
#Project guitar; 
#void setup() 
#{
 # guitar.setPin();
#}
#void loop() 
#{
#  guitar.playSound(); 
#}

##Motivation

Throughout history a common outlet for creativity is through music.  Research has shown that guitar is gaining traction by fast becoming the most popular instrument played due to its versatility, relatively lower cost (compared to pianos) and the rise of rock and pop music.  Our team aims to bring the freedom of creative expression to everyone while addressing some common complaints.  There have been similar projects in the past, however, our project aims to further improve the instrument by targeting problematic areas such as further reducing the cost of, and improving the portability and ease of composition.  We aim to accomplish two things: to simplify the instrument and to construct an intuitive design.
